# About me
- My academic interests lie in computers, electronics, and programming. I want to learn more about how computers and electronics work and how they can be improved through software, hardware, and electromagnetics.
- My extracurriculars at Duke include being on the Women's Club Basketball ad Jewish Student Union executive committees, as well as a member of Duke Technology Scholars and Society of Women Engineers.
- Outside of academic and career endeavors, I enjoy playing basketball or softball, weightlifting, reading, listening to music, and spending time outdoors.
